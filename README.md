# Introductory scripting course

I devloped and taught this course at [Graz University of Technology](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The intended audience of the course are people with educational background in biology with little-to-no prior exposure to programming. 

## Contents
There are 8 lecture slide decks in `lectures` and 10 lab exercise sets in `labs`. The technical level is quite basic in order to be suitable for people with little computing experience, yet it covers key topics they might find useful in working with biological data, including:
- Basics of Linux
- Python scripting
- Regular expressions
- Perl one-liners
- API access to biological databases
- Bash scripting
- R scripting
